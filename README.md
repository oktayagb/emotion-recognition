Hello,
This is a project I've been working on Kaggle, I just imported the notebook. If you need more details you can open the notebook.
I didn't run the training of the model because Kaggle didn't have enough memory, I'll train the model in the future.

# Goal
This is a notebook in which I'm going to try to use deep learning techniques in order to do image classification. 
The dataset contains face images and the emotion of these faces. 
We are going to try to solve this classification problem while also taking in account the fact that the classes of this dataset are imbalanced (data augmentation) and that training might be very long (transfer learning).
